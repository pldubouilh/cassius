### Welcome to Cassius !

### Some explanaitions...
This project is quite simple ; it consists on a website that is opened in an osx webview.
This website is in the /public folder. It can easily be ported to any OS/Browser. It's supposed to work out of the box on a Webkit browser. Firefox support is on the way, but there still are some raw edges.
### TODO

* [Add icon to DB](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5739330/using-cocoa-to-create-an-icon-for-a-folder)
