### Welcome to Cassius !
The sources are released under the terms of the GNU GPL v3.

### Some explanaitions...
This project is quite simple ; it consists on a website that is opened in an osx webview.

This website is in the /public folder. It can easily be ported to any OS/Browser. It's supposed to work out of the box on a Webkit browser. Firefox support is on the way, but there still are some raw edges.

### Special thanks
This software relies heavily on awesome free projects, like : MacGap, Bootstrap, FlatUI, crypto.js, SJCL, jStorage, Bootstrap WYSIWYG, Tipsy… Many thanks to the authors !
